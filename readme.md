# What is this

This is a example package I made fot the company I'm working with - yourcar | You can visit their website on https://yourcar.co.nz/

---

# How do I use this package?

install using `npm i npm-richard-example --save`
This package has four methods: `sum`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide`

# Frist step:

`import {sum, subtract, multiply, divide} from npm-richard-example`

# Then

`sum` takes 2 **numbers** `sum(a, b)` adds **a** to **b**,
`subtract` takes 2 **numbers** `subtract(a, b)` subtracts **a** to **b**,
`multiply` takes 2 **numbers** `multiply(a, b)` multiplies **a** to **b**,
`divide` takes 2 **numbers** `divide(a, b)` divides **a** to **b**,
